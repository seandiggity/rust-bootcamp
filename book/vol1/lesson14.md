# Lesson 14 - nalgebra

> Relevancy: 1.9 stable

The [nalgebra](https://crates.io/crates/nalgebra) crate provides a wide set of mathematical primitives for linear algebra, computer physics, graphic engines etc. I'm not going to dive deep into the underlying math, there are a lot of tutorials and courses, some of them specifically targeted at the programmers. My goal for today is just a brief showcase of what we can do in Rust with `nalgebra`.

Basic vector and matrix operations
----------------------------------

[include:29-34](../../vol1/src/bin/lesson14.rs)

```sh
$ cargo run
Vec2 { x: 1, y: 0 }
```

In `nalgebra` there are several statically sized vector and square matrix types (for dimensions up to 6). The standard mathematical operators are overloaded, so all allowed kinds of vector/matrix multiplication should just work. In the example above we defined the [rotation matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix) ourselves, but there is a nice shortcut: the `RotN` type.

[include:35-37](../../vol1/src/bin/lesson14.rs)

The output is the same but this time we tell Rust *what* to do, not *how* to do it. Note that we need to wrap the `angle` in a single-element vector.

We can use vectors to translate (move) points.

[include:38-39](../../vol1/src/bin/lesson14.rs)

A number of other operations are also exposed as top-level functions, such as `transform()`, `rotate()` along with their inverse counterparts.

Dot and cross product
---------------------

[include:41-48](../../vol1/src/bin/lesson14.rs)

The output is:

```sh
$ cargo run
v1 is orthogonal to v2
Vec3 { x: 0, y: 0, z: -8 }
Vec3 { x: 0, y: 0, z: 8 }
```

[Dot product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) can be used to check if two vectors are orthogonal to each other. That happens if their dot product is equal to 0. As floating point comparisons are [sometimes suprising](http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq/floating-point-arith.html), we should use the `approx_eq()` function.

The [cross product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product) of two vectors is always perpendicular (sometimes we say **normal**) to *both* of them. As you can see from the example it is also not commutative. Normal vectors are very important in computer graphics for [calculating light and shading](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-8-basic-shading/) of the scene.

Dynamic vectors
---------------

All of the `nalgebra` types we've seen so far have their higher-dimensional variants up to `Vec6`/`Mat6` etc. But what if we want to go further? Very high number of dimensions is common for example in digital signal processing. In `nalgebra` there is a `DVec` type for that purpose.

[include:50-62](../../vol1/src/bin/lesson14.rs)

We can use the `from_fn()` mwthod to create a vector by generating each element in a closure. The `window` variable is a [Hamming window](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function#Hamming_window); such window functions are a common preprocessing step in DSP.

The `draw()` function borrows a `DVec` and a `Path` and plots a simple representation of the vector to a PNG file using the [image crate](https://siciarz.net/24-days-of-rust-image/). The code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/zsiciarz/24daysofrust/blob/9a88969f156581da8ba16ae50c87d884983b17c9/src/day14.rs#L11) for anybody interested. Here's the output of all three steps of the above code:
